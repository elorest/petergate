Installation
------
##### Get the gem
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'petergate'

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install petergate

##### Prerequisites: Setup Authentication (Devise)

Make sure your user model is defined in
    app/models/user.rb
and called User.

If you're using [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) you're in luck, otherwise you'll have to add following methods to your project:

    current_user
    after_sign_in_path_for(current_user)
    authenticate_user!

##### Run the generators

    rails g petergate:install
    rake db:migrate

This will add a migration and insert petergate into your User model.

Usage
------
#### User Model

Configure available roles by modifying this block at the top of your user.rb.

```ruby
############################################################################################
## PeterGate Roles                                                                        ##
## The :user role is added by default and shouldn't be included in this list.             ##
## The :root_admin can access any page regardless of access settings. Use with caution!   ##
## The multiple option can be set to true if you need users to have multiple roles.       ##
petergate(roles: [:admin, :editor], multiple: false)                                      ##
############################################################################################
```

##### Instance Methods

```ruby
user.role => :editor
user.roles => [:editor, :user]
user.roles=(v) #sets roles
user.available_roles => [:admin, :editor]
user.has_roles?(:admin, :editors) # returns true if user is any of roles passed in as params.
```
##### Class Methods

`User.#{role}_editors => #list of editors. Method is created for all roles. Roles [admin, :teacher] will have corresponding methods role_admins, role_teachers, etc.`

#### Controllers

Setup permissions in your controllers the same as you would for a before filter like so:

```ruby
access all: [:show, :index], user: {except: [:destroy]}, company_admin: :all

# one other option that might seem a bit weird is to put a group of roles in an array:
access [:all, :user] => [:show, :index]
```

Inside your views you can use logged_in?(:admin, :customer, :etc) to show or hide content.

```erb
<%= link_to "destroy", destroy_listing_path(listing) if logged_in?(:admin, :customer, :etc) %>
```

If you need to access available roles within your project you can by calling:

```ruby
User::ROLES
# or from an instance
User.first.available_roles
# ROLES is a CONSTANT and will still work from within the User model instance methods
# like in this default setter:

def roles=(v)
  self[:roles] = v.map(&:to_sym).to_a.select{|r| r.size > 0 && ROLES.include?(r)}
end
```
If you need to deny access you can use the forbidden! method:

```ruby
before_action :check_active_user

def check_active_user
  forbidden! unless current_user.active
end
```
If you want to change the `permission denied` message you can add to the access line:

```ruby
access user: [:show, :index], message: "You shall not pass"
```

#### User Admin Example Form for Multiple Roles

```slim
= form_for @user do |f| 
  - if @user.errors.any? 
    #error_explanation 
      h2 = "#{pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error")} prohibited this user from being saved:" 
      ul 
        - @user.errors.full_messages.each do |message| 
          li = message 
 
  .field 
    = f.label :email 
    = f.text_field :email 
  - if @user.new_record? || params[:passwd] 
    .field 
      = f.label :password 
      = f.text_field :password 
    .field 
      = f.label :password_confirmation 
      = f.text_field :password_confirmation 
  .field 
    = f.label :roles 
    = f.select :roles, @user.available_roles, {}, {multiple: true} 
  .actions = f.submit 
```

#### User Admin Example Form for Single Role Mode

```slim
= form_for @user do |f| 
  - if @user.errors.any? 
    #error_explanation 
      h2 = "#{pluralize(@user.errors.count, "error")} prohibited this user from being saved:" 
      ul 
        - @user.errors.full_messages.each do |message| 
          li = message 
 
  .field 
    = f.label :email 
    = f.text_field :email 
  - if @user.new_record? || params[:passwd] 
    .field 
      = f.label :password 
      = f.text_field :password 
    .field 
      = f.label :password_confirmation 
      = f.text_field :password_confirmation 
  .field 
    = f.label :role 
    = f.select :role, @user.available_roles
  .actions = f.submit 
```
